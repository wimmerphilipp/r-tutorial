# obviously you could still use the full path. Note, that you need to change \ to /

# 1. Clean up the environment
rm(list = ls())  # Remove all objects from the R environment to start fresh.

# 2. Introduction to EU-SILC data
# EU-SILC contains data across four different sheets:
# - 'p': Individual-level data (e.g., income, demographics)
# - 'r': Register data (technical details about individuals)
# - 'd': Household-level data (economic data at the household level)
# - 'h': Technical household data

# 3. Load the four datasets
load("AT_CD_2013_small.RData")  # Load household-level data ('d')
load("AT_CH_2013_small.RData")  # Load technical household-level data ('h')
load("AT_CP_2013_small.RData")  # Load individual-level data ('p')
load("AT_CR_2013_small.Rdata")  # Load register data ('r')

# Note: These files are sample data for Austria (2013) and are not representative.

# 4. Create unique ID variables for merging datasets later
# Create a unique household ID ('id_h') for each file
aut_h$id_h <- paste(aut_h$HB020, aut_h$HB030, sep="")  # Combine Country-Code + Household ID from 'h'
aut_d$id_h <- paste(aut_d$DB020, aut_d$DB030, sep="")  # Combine Country-Code + Household ID from 'd'

aut_r$id_h <- paste(aut_r$RB020, aut_r$RX030, sep="")  # Combine Country-Code + Household ID from 'r'

# Create a unique personal ID ('id_p') for each file
aut_p$id_p <- paste(aut_p$PB020, aut_p$PB030, sep="")  # Combine Country-Code + Personal ID from 'p'
aut_r$id_p <- paste(aut_r$RB020, aut_r$RB030, sep="")  # Combine Country-Code + Personal ID from 'r'

# 5. Compare and merge household data
# Check for households that are in 'd' but not in 'h'
testjoin_hh <- anti_join(aut_d, aut_h, by="id_h")  # Find rows in 'aut_d' with no match in 'aut_h'
testjoin_hh  # Display the unmatched rows

# Merge the household datasets: 'd' (economic) and 'h' (technical)
aut_hh <- right_join(aut_d, aut_h, by="id_h")  # Keep all rows from 'h', add matching rows from 'd'

# 6. Compare and merge individual-level data
# Check for individuals that are in 'r' but not in 'p'
testjoin_p <- anti_join(aut_r, aut_p, by = c("id_p" = "id_p", "id_h" = "id_h"))  
# `anti_join` finds rows in 'aut_r' with no match in 'aut_p'

# The result shows that some individuals appear in the register ('r') but do not have full data in 'p'.
# This happens when interviews were incomplete, so only technical data exists.

# Merge the individual datasets: 'r' (register) and 'p' (data)
aut_indiv <- right_join(aut_r, aut_p, by = c("id_p" = "id_p", "id_h" = "id_h"))  
# Keep all rows from 'p', add matching rows from 'r'

# 7. Merge household data with individual data
# Combine the merged household dataset (aut_hh) with the merged individual dataset (aut_indiv)
data <- right_join(aut_hh, aut_indiv, by = "id_h")  
# Keep all rows from 'aut_indiv', add matching household data from 'aut_hh'

# 8. Clean up unnecessary objects
