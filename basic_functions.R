## Loops
# In R you have multiple options when repeating calculations: vectorized 
# operations, loops and apply functions.
# while loops:
# these loops are similar to the if statement. it executes the code inside if
# the condition is true. However, the while loop executes the code over and 
# over again, as long as the condition is true.

while(condition) {  # if this condition holds
  expr              # what do we want the while loop to do on every iteration
}

# example:
count <- 1
while(count <= 7) {
  print(paste("count is set to", count))
  count <- count+1
}
# note that we have two expressions in this example. one tells the loop what to
# print. and the other increments the count variable to prevent the loop from
# running endlessly.
count

# break statement:
# the break statement simply breaks out of the while. in this example we want
# the break statement to activate as soon as count reaches a level divisible
# by 5
count <- 1
while(count <=7) {
  if(count %% 5 ==0){
    break
  }
  print(paste("count is set to", count))
  count <- count+1
}
count

# for loops:
# for each variable in a sequence, run the following expression
for(var in seq) {
  expr
}
# example
cities <- c("Turin", "Barcelona", "London", "Paris", "Havanna",
            "Wien", "Mexico City", "Hongkong", "Hamburg")
cities

for(city in cities){
  print(city)
}
city
# note that the for loop automatically identifies "cities" as a sequence, 
# containing different variables. Each city is a value of this sequence. 
# Here, we told R to print every variable of the sequence separately.
# the for loop also works with lists:
cities <- list("Turin", "Barcelona", "London", "Paris", "Havanna",
            "Wien", "Mexiko City", "Hongkong", "Hamburg")
cities

for(city in cities){
  print(city)
}
city

# break-statement also works with foor loops
for(city in cities){
  if (nchar(city) == 6) {
    break
  }
  print(city)
}
# the break statement stops the loop as soon as it encounters a name with
# character length being equal to 6. In this case London, which is no longer
# printed out.

# you can also use the "next" statement
for(city in cities){
  if(nchar(city) == 6){
    next
  }
  print(city)
}

# the next statement skips those entries violating our if condition and
# proceeds to the next iteration

## advanced looping
# additionally to print out the city name, we also want to have information on
# the variables' position inside the vector. Therefore, we need to adapt the
# "looping index". This index is the counter R uses behind the scenes to know 
# which element to select on every iteration. 
# Now instead of iterating over the cities, we will manually create the index.
cities <- list("Turin", "Barcelona", "London", "Paris", "Havanna",
               "Wien", "Mexiko City", "Hongkong", "Hamburg")
cities

for(i in 1:length(cities)) {
  print(cities[i])
